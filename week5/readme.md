    The split() method splits a string into a list.

    map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)
    e.g.
    map(fun, iter)
    Parameters :
    fun : It is a function to which map passes each element of given iterable.
    iter : It is a iterable which is to be mapped.
